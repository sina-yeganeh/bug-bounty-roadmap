# Authentication Issues
Three main type of authentication:
- Something you know, knowledge factors 
- Something you have, possession factor
- Something you are, Inherent factor 

### Different between *authentication* and *authorization*?
- Authentication: process of verifying that a user is who.
- Authorization: what user can do.

### How authentication is vulnerable?
- The mechanism is weak against brute-force attack.
- They can be bypassed - *"Broken authentication"*

### Vulnerabilities in password-based login
Note for brute-forcing:
- Status code
- Error message
- Response time
