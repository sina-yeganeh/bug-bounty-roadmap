# Bug Bounty Roadmap
This repository is just a personal to-do list for becoming a bug hunter. I published it in case anyone is interested in my journey. I should mention that I studied networking and have 3 to 4 years of non-professional programming experience. So That's why I did not add some fundemental stuff to learn.

## Tools
### Burpsuit
- [ ] Proxy

### Recon
- [ ] `amass` - subdomain enum
- [ ] `subfinder`
- [ ] `httpx`
- [x] `nmap`

### Fuzzing and Exploitation
This is not a complete list, I will add other tools later.
- [x] `fuff`
- [ ] `wfuzz`

## Resource
Here is a list of my resources to learn this path:
- [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics)
- TryHackMe
- HackTheBox

## To-Do Table
Every Friday, I add a new task for the following week, along with a link to the course or content if it is available.
