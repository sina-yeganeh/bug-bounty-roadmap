# Bug Bounty Roadmap
This repository is just a personal to-do list for becoming a bug hunter. I published it in case anyone is interested in my journey. I should mention that I studied networking and have 3 to 4 years of non-professional programming experience. So That's why I did not add some fundemental stuff to learn.
